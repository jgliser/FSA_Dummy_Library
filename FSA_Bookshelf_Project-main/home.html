            The Tao that can be told <br>
is not the eternal Tao. <br>
The name that can be named <br>
is not the eternal name. <br>

The Tao is both named and nameless. <br>
As nameless it is the origin of all things; <br>
as named it is the Mother of 10,000 things. <br>

Ever desireless, one can see the mystery; <br>
ever desiring, one sees only the manifestations. <br>
And the mystery itself is the doorway <br>
to all understanding. <br>
